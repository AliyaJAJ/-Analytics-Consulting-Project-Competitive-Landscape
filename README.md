# Analytics Consulting Project: Competitive Landscape


This project focused on analyzing the competitive landscape for Ironhack in the coding school industry. We created and populated a comprehensive database with coding schools that were direct competitors to Ironhack, with focus on the top 5 Data Analytics Bootcamps.
 
The project involved designing suitable queries in SQL to answer the following business questions of interest:

1.Overall Score of Data Analytics Program: 
We assessed the quality and reputation of each data analytics bootcamp by providing an aggregated score.
 
2.Campus Availability: 
We determined the count of available locations for each bootcamp to understand their geographical reach.
 
3.Average Score for Data Analytics Course: 
We compared average scores for the data analytics course between 2022 and 2023, considering both remote and in-person formats.

Through this analytics consulting project, Ironhack gained valuable insights into their competitors' performance, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding their curriculum, campus expansion, and market positioning.
